# Dashboard-API
This is a RESTful API that provides everyday features such as a Spotify Controller, which allows users to log-in and remotely change songs and modify playlists from any device. It was inspired by a feature I wanted from Spotify where I could add the currently playing song to a pre-selected playlist, without having to choose the playlist each time. With this API I not only added my new feature along with some other basic Spotify controls, but I also added a To-Do-List as I use one often, and designed the architecture such that I could add new features in the future as needed.
